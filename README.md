ECMarket uses CocoaPods for managing the installation of third-party libraries. <br/>
If you don't already have it installed, here's how you can do so:
Using RubyGems
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapod
```
Using Homebrew
```
$ brew install cocoapods
```
Run **`$ pod install`** in project's root directory.
